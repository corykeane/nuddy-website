NUDDY Lore
The Mage first appeared on the Moon during the age of Leo on a cloud of nebulous space dust where he was astounded by the vibrant plant life and intelligent animals emerging out of the glacial blue planet. He found them far too savage and returned home to a hidden star system deep in the neighbouring Andromeda galaxy for several millennia.

The Mage re-emerged in the Age of Gemini to study Alchemical discoveries under the Great Scribe, Hermes Trismegistus and was inspired by the beautiful rhythms and harmonies that the Homo Sapiens had developed since his first visit. The Mage was humbled by the effects of music on the soul and was given the name "Nod'he" by the Guardian of the Earth in honour of the synchronistic harmony between the Earth and the Lunar and Solar bodies represented by the alchemical symbol ☾⨁ and sent on a quest across the cosmos to find the "Vibrationis Ultima", the ultimate vibe and return it to the Kingdom of Man. With only a walnut staff, a black magic pack and knowledge of darkness and light, Nod'he was able to vanquish many foes and banish beings of chaos to the void.

Now at the dawning of the age of Aquarius Nod'he has returned to the Heliosphere to celebrate gifts of universal wisdom and to help all beings navigate the technosphere by casting fire beats and conjuring cold melodies with the help of an Earthling polymath of Turtle Island named Marc Mahé who channels the celestial wizard's magic from the Ethereal realm.

Together they are NUDDY.
